:question: **What is this Repository About?**

When writing automated tests, the necessity to create complex objects with numerous configuration options can often lead to cluttered and hard-to-maintain test code. The Builder design pattern addresses this challenge by allowing the construction of objects step by step, focusing only on the relevant options for each test scenario. This tutorial will introduce you to the Builder design pattern, demonstrating its application in simplifying object creation in automated testing, making your test code cleaner and more maintainable.

**What Will You Learn?**

- **Introduction to the Builder Design Pattern:** Gain an understanding of the Builder design pattern and its importance in creating complex objects in a maintainable and understandable way.

- **Applying Builder in Automated Tests:** Step-by-step instructions on how to implement the Builder pattern in your test projects to streamline the creation of complex test data.

- **Simplifying Object Creation with TestDataDirector:** Learn how to use TestDataDirector alongside builders to efficiently orchestrate the construction of intricate data models, like a music artist’s entire discography, within your tests.

**:key: What is the Builder Design Pattern?**

The Builder Design Pattern is a creation design pattern that allows for the construction of complex objects step by step. This pattern is particularly useful in automated testing, where it enables testers to create detailed test data without cluttering the test code. By using specific builders for each component of a complex object, such as artists, albums, and tracks in a music application, the Builder pattern helps in maintaining a clear separation between test setup and test logic. This separation significantly reduces code duplication and potential errors, ensuring that test classes remain clean and focused solely on testing logic.

**:file_folder: What is the Repository Design Pattern?**
The Repository Design Pattern is a strategy used in software development to separate the way data is stored and retrieved from the business logic of an application. This pattern acts as a bridge between the application's business logic and the database or data source, providing a central place for all data access operations.

**:factory: What is the Factory Design Pattern?**
The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It addresses the problem of creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created, using a Factory method instead of direct constructor calls.

### Steps to Run Tests Locally in Visual Studio with C#

1. **Open the Project:** Launch Visual Studio and open your C# project.

2. **Run Tests:**
   - **Single Test Method:** Right-click on the test method name > `Run Tests`.
   - **All Tests in a Test Class:** Right-click on the test class file > `Run Tests`.

### Running Tests on LambdaTest

To execute tests on LambdaTest, you need to set up environment variables in your Visual Studio test configurations:

- `LT_USERNAME` with your LambdaTest username.
- `LT_ACCESS_KEY` with your LambdaTest access key.

### Configuring Test Settings in Visual Studio

1. **Access Test Settings:** Navigate to `Test` > `Configure Run Settings` > `Select Solution Wide runsettings File` for broader configurations or use the `Test Explorer` context menu for specific settings.
2. **Set Environment Variables:** In your `.runsettings` file or through the Test Explorer context menu, add your LambdaTest credentials.
   - Include `<EnvironmentVariables>` in your `.runsettings` file with `LT_USERNAME` and `LT_ACCESS_KEY` values.

### Viewing Test Results

Test results are available in the `Test Explorer` window, providing information on passed and failed tests, execution times, and detailed error messages.
